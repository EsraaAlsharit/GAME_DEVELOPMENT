Create a new method named "Multiply" which takes 4 parameters two of type double.
Body of the method should cast all the parameters from double to int then multiply each of the parameters by one another, so if you have x,y,z,w you multiply all the 4 by one another.
Hint 1: the multiplication symbol is *
Hint 2: You need to search for the method which converts double to int in C#; you cannot use normal casting in previous lesson.
Return the output of the multiplication as int (so your method should be returning an int).
Call the method in your Main() method with the four numbers like this Multiply(1.2, 1.5, 3.4, 7.2); 
Print out the result of that method.
