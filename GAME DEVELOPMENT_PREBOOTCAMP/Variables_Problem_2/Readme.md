# Problem 2
### Learning Objectives:

- Implement multiple variables in the same program.
- Practice converting variables from one data type to another.
##
Write a C# program that performs the following tasks:

1. Declare a variable `age` of type `int` and assign it a value of `25`.
1. Declare a variable `name` of type `string` and assign it a value of your choice.
1. Declare a variable `price` of type `double` and assign it a value of `19.99`.
1. Declare a variable `isMember` of type `bool` and assign it a value of `true`.
1. Print out the values of all four variables to the console using `Console.WriteLine()`.
1. Cast the value of `age` to a `double` and assign the result to a new variable `ageAsDouble`.
1. Cast the value of `price` to an `int` and assign the result to a new variable `priceAsInt`.
1. Print out the values of `ageAsDouble` and `priceAsInt` to the console.

Here is some sample output that your program should produce:

```
age: 25, name: John, price: 19.99, isMember: TrueageAsDouble: 25, priceAsInt: 19
```

Try to write the program on your own, and if you get stuck or have any questions, feel free to ask for help. Good luck! Here is some sample output that your program should produce:
