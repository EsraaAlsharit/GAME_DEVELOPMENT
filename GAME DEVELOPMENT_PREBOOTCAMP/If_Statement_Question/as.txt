the x is 7 the first if condition checking if x equal to 5 
which the condition is false
 so go to next else if x grater than 5 and less than 10
here the condition is true so it enter the condition to say
"I am inside if x is greater than 5 and less than 10 condition, X: value is 7"
"We just decreased x value by 1 using the -- operator, new x value is: 6"
